          <h2>Solo Project: ThreadBare</h2>
          <p>My solo project for Prime Digital Academy is a web-based application called ThreadBare.
          ThreadBare is for shoppers whose clothing sizes fall outside of "standard sizing" and can sometimes have difficulty finding their size.
          With this app, users can search for retailers that carry their size, and can even contribute retailers they know of to the database.
          This app was created using React, Redux, and PostgreSQL, among others. ThreadBare was styled with MUI CSS.

          <h2>Group Client Project: Maximum 1â„¢ Life App</h2>
          <p>As part of my final project with Prime Digital Academy, I along with a group of my peers developed an application for a local business. 
            The Life App allows users to create self-reflection journals referred to as "trees" to work through problematic behaviors and/or thought patterns.
            The app was developed with React, Redux, JavaScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL and was styled with React Bootstrap.</p>
